## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-18

### ðŸŽ‰ First Open Source Release

This marks the first public release of the AI Workflow Engine, a production-ready workflow orchestration system built in Rust with Python MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **Workspace Architecture**: Restructured as a Rust workspace with 5 specialized crates
  - `workflow-core`: Core workflow engine with type-safe node system
  - `workflow-nodes`: Built-in node implementations for AI operations
  - `mcp-client`: Complete Model Context Protocol client implementation
  - `workflow-api`: REST API server with OpenAPI documentation
  - `workflow-examples`: Comprehensive examples and tutorials
- **Type-Safe Node System**: Compile-time checked workflow nodes with `NodeId<T>` and `AsyncNode` trait
- **Multi-Transport MCP Support**: HTTP, WebSocket, and stdio transports for flexible integration
- **External Service Integrations**: Python MCP servers for HelpScout, Notion, and Slack
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: README files, API docs, and inline documentation for all public APIs
- **Example Workflows**: Multiple example implementations demonstrating various use cases
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing, linting, and releases
- **Docker Support**: Multi-stage Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and structured logging
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL integration with Diesel ORM and migration support

#### Developer Experience
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with thiserror, no unwrap/panic in production code
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end test suites
- **Development Scripts**: Helper scripts for starting test servers and running workflows
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Auto-generated API documentation at `/swagger-ui/`
- **Health Checks**: Detailed health endpoint for monitoring system status
- **Correlation Tracking**: Request correlation IDs for distributed tracing

- **Issue Templates**: GitHub issue templates for bugs and feature requests
- **Security Policy**: SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process
- **Code of Conduct**: Community guidelines for inclusive collaboration

### Changed

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into focused crates for better maintainability
- **Async-First**: All node operations and API endpoints use async/await
- **Repository Pattern**: Consistent data access layer across all database operations
- **Service Bootstrap**: Dependency injection container for clean initialization
- **Protocol Abstraction**: Unified interface for different MCP transport mechanisms

#### API Enhancements
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent REST API following best practices
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for API protection
- **CORS Support**: Configurable CORS for web application integration
- **Request Validation**: Input validation with detailed error messages

### Fixed

#### Stability Improvements
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling throughout the codebase
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of connections and resources
- **Concurrency Safety**: Thread-safe operations with appropriate synchronization
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structures and streaming where appropriate
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient reuse of MCP client connections

### Security
