# Instructions for Updating Main Branch README

## Overview
The main branch README should be updated to clearly distinguish it from the federation-ui branch and help users choose the right version.

## Files to Update on Main Branch

### 1. Replace `/README.md` on main branch with:
Use the content from `MAIN_BRANCH_README.md` in this directory.

### 2. Key Changes Needed:
- Add branch comparison table
- Clarify that main is the "streamlined version"
- Add clear guidance on when to use each branch
- Simplify the architecture diagram to show monolithic structure
- Add links to federation-ui branch
- Update quick start to reflect simpler setup

## Commands to Execute (from main branch directory):

```bash
# Switch to main branch (if not already there)
git checkout main

# Update README with new content
# (Copy content from MAIN_BRANCH_README.md)

# Commit the changes
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: Update main branch README to distinguish from federation-ui

- Add branch comparison table showing main vs federation-ui differences
- Clarify main branch as streamlined, monolithic version
- Add guidance on when to choose each branch
- Simplify architecture diagram for monolithic structure
- Link to federation-ui branch for enterprise features

This helps users choose the right branch for their needs."

# Optional: Push changes
git push origin main
```

## Key Messages to Convey:

### Main Branch Positioning:
- **Simple & Fast**: 5-minute setup, single service
- **Learning Friendly**: Great for understanding concepts
- **Prototype Ready**: Perfect for quick proofs of concept
- **Production Capable**: But not enterprise-scale

### Federation-UI Branch Positioning:
- **Enterprise Ready**: 95% publication ready
- **Production Scale**: Microservices + monitoring
- **Feature Complete**: React frontend, 174+ tests
- **Security Hardened**: 70+ vulnerabilities prevented

### Clear Decision Tree:
- New to Rust workflows → main branch
- Learning/prototyping → main branch  
- Production deployment → federation-ui branch
- Enterprise features needed → federation-ui branch

## Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Reduces Confusion**: Clear distinction between branches
2. **Improves Onboarding**: Users start with appropriate complexity
3. **Professional Image**: Shows mature project with options
4. **Better SEO**: Each branch has clear value proposition
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Each branch has focused documentation
