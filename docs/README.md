## üîç Core Concepts

### Architecture Overview
1. **Workflows**: Directed graphs of processing nodes
2. **Nodes**: Individual processing units (AI agents, MCP clients, templates)
3. **Events**: Event-sourced architecture with CQRS
4. **MCP**: Model Context Protocol for external integrations
5. **Services**: Microservice architecture with specialized components

### Service Components
- **workflow-engine-api**: Main HTTP API server
- **workflow-engine-core**: Core workflow logic and AI integration
- **workflow-engine-mcp**: Model Context Protocol implementation
- **workflow-engine-nodes**: Built-in workflow nodes
- **Content Processing**: Document analysis and processing
- **Knowledge Graph**: Graph database integration
- **Realtime Communication**: WebSocket-based messaging

### Example Workflows
