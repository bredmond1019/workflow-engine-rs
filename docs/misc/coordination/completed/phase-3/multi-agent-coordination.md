# Multi-Agent Coordination: AI Workflow Orchestration System

## Agent Overview

### Agent Count: 5

**Rationale:** The AI Workflow Orchestration System is a complex, 26-week implementation with distinct functional areas that can work in parallel. The system includes foundation/DevOps work, core AI functionality, external service integrations, database/event architecture, and production/security concerns. Five agents optimize parallel execution while maintaining clear responsibility boundaries and manageable coordination overhead.

### Agent Roles

1. **DevOps & Foundation Agent:** Development environment, database setup, documentation accuracy, and testing infrastructure
2. **AI & Core Engine Agent:** AI agent implementations, workflow engine enhancements, and core business logic functionality  
3. **Integration & Services Agent:** Service bootstrap management, MCP integration completion, and microservices communication
4. **Database & Events Agent:** Event sourcing implementation, database architecture, and microservices data isolation
5. **Production & QA Agent:** Production deployment, performance testing, security hardening, and comprehensive QA

## Task Distribution Summary

### Original Task List Breakdown

- **DevOps & Foundation Agent:** Tasks 1.0 (1.1-1.5) - Foundation Stabilization
- **AI & Core Engine Agent:** Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.5 - AI agents, workflow engine, monitoring
- **Integration & Services Agent:** Tasks 2.3, 3.0 (3.1-3.5) - Service bootstrap, MCP integration, microservices
- **Database & Events Agent:** Tasks 2.4, 4.1, 4.2 - Error handling, event sourcing, data isolation
- **Production & QA Agent:** Tasks 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.0 (5.1-5.5) - Production deployment, monitoring, performance, security

### Workload Distribution

| Agent | Parent Tasks | Sub-tasks | Estimated Weeks | Focus Area |
|-------|--------------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| DevOps & Foundation | 1 | 5 | 4 weeks | Environment & Documentation |
| AI & Core Engine | 3 | 3 | 6 weeks | Core Functionality |
| Integration & Services | 2 | 8 | 8 weeks | Service Integration |
| Database & Events | 3 | 3 | 7 weeks | Data Architecture |
| Production & QA | 4 | 8 | 7 weeks | Production & Quality |

## Critical Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies (must happen in order)

1. **DevOps & Foundation → All Other Agents:** Foundation Stabilization (Tasks 1.0) must complete before any other development can proceed effectively
   - Database setup and environment configuration enables all other development
   - Fixed test infrastructure required for quality development practices
   - Working documentation examples needed as implementation reference

2. **AI & Core Engine → Integration & Services:** AI agent completion (Task 2.1) must finish before MCP tool implementation (Task 3.2)
   - Customer support MCP tools require working AI agents for business logic
   - Service bootstrap may need AI capabilities for intelligent routing

3. **Database & Events → AI & Core Engine:** Error handling framework (Task 2.4) should complete before workflow persistence (Task 2.2)
   - Workflow engine needs comprehensive error handling for reliable persistence
   - Event sourcing infrastructure needed for workflow state management

4. **Integration & Services → Production & QA:** Service integration (Tasks 3.0) must complete before production deployment (Tasks 4.3, 5.0)
   - Complete service integration required for end-to-end testing
   - MCP integrations needed for performance and security testing

5. **Database & Events → Production & QA:** Event sourcing implementation (Task 4.1) must complete before production monitoring (Task 4.4)
   - Event sourcing provides data for distributed tracing and monitoring
   - Database isolation needed for production scaling and performance testing

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation Only
- **DevOps & Foundation Agent** works independently on foundation stabilization
- All other agents can prepare and plan but cannot start implementation

#### Phase 2A (Weeks 5-8): Core Development Begins  
- **AI & Core Engine Agent** and **Database & Events Agent** can work simultaneously
  - AI agent implementation (2.1) and error handling (2.4) are independent
  - Workflow engine (2.2) can begin after basic error handling is available

#### Phase 2B (Weeks 9-12): Service Integration
- **Integration & Services Agent** takes primary focus with support from others
  - Can work on service bootstrap (2.3) independently
  - MCP tool implementation (3.2) requires completed AI agents from previous phase

#### Phase 3 (Weeks 13-26): Production Readiness
- **Production & QA Agent** takes primary focus
- **Database & Events Agent** provides event sourcing (4.1) and isolation (4.2)
- Other agents provide support and bug fixes as needed
