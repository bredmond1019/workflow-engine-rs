## Relevant Files

- `Cargo.toml` - Main project configuration

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (What this agent needs before starting)

- None - This agent handles critical blockers first

### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)

- **To All Agents:** Working build system and compilable codebase
- **To Integration Agent:** Bootstrap container for service registration
- **To Data Services Agent:** Configuration management system
- **To QA Agent:** Fixed test compilation and CI/CD pipeline

## Handoff Points

- **After Task 1.5:** Notify all agents that build is fixed and tests compile
- **After Task 4.2:** Notify Integration and Data Services agents that dependency injection is ready
- **After Task 4.4:** Notify all agents that configuration management is available

## Testing Responsibilities

- Ensure all compilation errors are fixed
- Verify 298 tests are discoverable
- Create unit tests for bootstrap system components
- Set up CI/CD to prevent future build breaks

## Notes

- Priority is fixing compilation errors first (Task 1.0) as this blocks all other work
- Bootstrap system should be designed for easy integration with existing code
- Document any breaking changes discovered during compilation fixes
- Coordinate with other agents if API changes affect their work
