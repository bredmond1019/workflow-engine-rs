# Multi-Agent Coordination: Production Readiness Implementation

## Agent Overview

### Agent Count: 4

**Rationale:** Four agents provide optimal parallelization while maintaining clear ownership boundaries. The Build & Infrastructure Agent handles critical blockers first, while Integration and Data Services agents can work in parallel on their respective domains. The QA Agent follows behind to ensure quality standards.

### Agent Roles

1. **Build & Infrastructure Engineer:** Compilation fixes and bootstrap system creation
2. **Integration Engineer:** Customer support tool implementations (Slack, HelpScout, Notion)
3. **Data Services Engineer:** Knowledge graph functionality and Dgraph integration
4. **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Comprehensive testing and documentation

## Task Distribution Summary

### Original Task List Breakdown

- **Build & Infrastructure Engineer:** Tasks 1.0 (all sub-tasks) and 4.0 (all sub-tasks)
- **Integration Engineer:** Task 2.0 (all sub-tasks)
- **Data Services Engineer:** Task 3.0 (all sub-tasks)
- **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Task 5.0 (all sub-tasks) plus documentation verification

## Critical Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies (must happen in order)

1. **Build Agent → All Others:** Task 1.0 (compilation fixes) must complete before any other work can proceed
2. **Build Agent → Integration Agent:** Task 4.2 (dependency injection) should complete before integration work begins
3. **Integration Agent → QA Agent:** Task 2.0 (customer support tools) must complete before Task 5.4 (tool testing)
4. **Data Services Agent → QA Agent:** Task 3.0 (graph parsing) must complete before knowledge graph testing
5. **All Implementation Agents → QA Agent:** All implementations must complete before final integration testing (Task 5.5)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1:** Build Agent works alone on Task 1.0 (critical blocker)
- **Phase 2:** Integration Agent and Data Services Agent can work simultaneously on Tasks 2.0 and 3.0
- **Phase 3:** QA Agent can begin protocol/transport tests (Tasks 5.1-5.3) while others continue implementation
- **Phase 4:** All agents coordinate for final integration and testing

## Integration Milestones

1. **Build Restoration (Day 2-3):** Build Agent completes Task 1.0 - All tests compile successfully
2. **Infrastructure Ready (Day 5):** Build Agent completes bootstrap system - Dependency injection available
3. **Implementations Complete (Day 10):** Integration and Data Services agents complete their primary tasks
4. **Testing Coverage Achieved (Day 15):** QA Agent reaches 80%+ coverage on critical paths
5. **Production Ready (Day 15):** All 298 tests pass, documentation updated, system ready for deployment

## Communication Protocol

- **Daily Standups:** All agents report progress, blockers, and upcoming handoffs
- **Handoff Notifications:** Agents must explicitly notify others when deliverables are ready
- **Blocker Escalation:** Any blocking issue preventing progress must be raised immediately
- **Slack Channel:** #production-readiness for real-time coordination
- **Progress Tracking:** Update task checkboxes in individual agent files daily

## Shared Resources

- **MCP Connection Pool (`src/core/mcp/connection_pool.rs`):** Integration and QA agents - Coordinate testing efforts
- **Test Infrastructure (`tests/`):** All agents - Avoid conflicts in test file creation
- **Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`):** Build and QA agents - Coordinate updates
- **CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/`):** Build and QA agents - Ensure compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers

1. **Hidden Compilation Issues:** Build Agent should identify all issues in Task 1.4 before declaring victory
2. **External Service Dependencies:** Integration Agent needs MCP test servers running
3. **Dgraph Setup Complexity:** Data Services Agent may need Docker expertise
4. **Test Flakiness:** QA Agent should identify and fix flaky tests early

### Mitigation Strategies

- Build Agent creates comprehensive list of all compilation issues before fixing
- Integration Agent verifies test servers are accessible before starting
- Data Services Agent tests Dgraph setup independently first
- QA Agent implements retry logic and proper test isolation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All compilation errors fixed (Build Agent)
- [ ] All mock implementations replaced with real ones (Integration Agent)
- [ ] Knowledge graph queries execute successfully (Data Services Agent)
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved (QA Agent)
- [ ] All 298 tests pass consistently
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects implementation
- [ ] Production deployment checklist complete

## Timeline

### Week 1
- Days 1-3: Build Agent fixes compilation (Task 1.0)
- Days 3-5: Build Agent creates bootstrap system (Task 4.0)
- Days 3-5: Integration and Data Services agents begin work

### Week 2
- Days 6-10: Integration and Data Services agents complete implementations
- Days 6-10: QA Agent begins protocol/transport testing
- Days 8-10: Initial integration testing begins

### Week 3
- Days 11-13: QA Agent completes all testing tasks
- Days 13-14: Final integration testing and documentation
- Day 15: Production readiness verification

## Notes

- Build Agent has the critical path for the first 3 days
- Parallel work maximizes efficiency after compilation is fixed
- QA Agent should start testing completed components early
- Regular communication prevents integration issues
- Focus on getting to "green builds" as quickly as possible
