# Post-Agent 3 Tasks: Remaining Work for Production Readiness

## Overview

This document consolidates all remaining tasks identified after Agent 3 completion and the comprehensive DevOps project review. Tasks are prioritized by production criticality.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Production Blockers (Must Fix)

### 1. Customer Support Tool Implementations
**Issue**: All three customer support integrations return mock/hardcoded data instead of real API calls
**Impact**: Users will receive fake responses from support tools
**Files**:
- `src/core/mcp/clients/slack.rs`
- `src/core/mcp/clients/helpscout.rs`
- `src/core/mcp/clients/notion.rs`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **1.1** Replace mock Slack responses with real MCP client calls
- [ ] **1.2** Replace mock HelpScout responses with real MCP client calls
- [ ] **1.3** Replace mock Notion responses with real MCP client calls
- [ ] **1.4** Add integration tests for each customer support tool
- [ ] **1.5** Verify MCP connection pooling works with real implementations

### 2. Knowledge Graph Result Parsing
**Issue**: Query result parsing throws "not implemented" errors
**Impact**: All graph queries will fail in production
**Files**:
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/client/dgraph.rs`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **2.1** Implement `parse_query_result` for GraphQL responses
- [ ] **2.2** Implement `parse_mutation_result` for mutations
- [ ] **2.3** Add comprehensive error handling for parsing failures
- [ ] **2.4** Create unit tests for various response formats
- [ ] **2.5** Add integration tests with real Dgraph instance

### 3. Fix Test Compilation Errors
**Issue**: Test suite won't compile due to missing imports
**Impact**: Cannot verify code quality or run CI/CD
**Files**:
- `src/core/streaming/sse.rs` - Missing Duration import
- `src/core/ai/tokens/tests/pricing_tests.rs` - Missing VolumeTier import
- Event processing tests - Type mismatches

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **3.1** Add missing `use std::time::Duration` in sse.rs
- [ ] **3.2** Add missing `VolumeTier` import in pricing tests
- [ ] **3.3** Fix event processing type mismatches
- [ ] **3.4** Run full test suite to identify any other compilation issues
- [ ] **3.5** Ensure all 298 tests pass successfully

## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Tasks (Important but not blocking)

### 4. Service Bootstrap Implementation
**Issue**: Bootstrap initialization logic is incomplete
**Impact**: Manual configuration required, no dependency injection
**Files**:
- `src/bootstrap/` directory doesn't exist as claimed

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **4.1** Create `src/bootstrap/` directory structure
- [ ] **4.2** Implement dependency injection container
- [ ] **4.3** Add service initialization logic
- [ ] **4.4** Create configuration management system
- [ ] **4.5** Update README to reflect actual implementation

### 5. Missing Test Coverage
**Issue**: Critical components lack tests
**Impact**: Risk of regressions, quality concerns
**Areas**:
- MCP Protocol implementation (0% coverage)
- MCP Transport layers (0% coverage)
- External MCP Client node (0% coverage)
- Customer support tools (20% coverage)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **5.1** Add unit tests for MCP protocol implementation
- [ ] **5.2** Add tests for HTTP/WebSocket/stdio transports
- [ ] **5.3** Create tests for external MCP client node
- [ ] **5.4** Increase customer support tool test coverage to 80%+
- [ ] **5.5** Add integration tests for cross-component interactions

### 6. Documentation Updates
**Issue**: README claims features that don't exist or are incomplete
**Impact**: Developer confusion, incorrect expectations

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **6.1** Remove bootstrap directory references from README
- [ ] **6.2** Add "Implementation Status" section to README
- [ ] **6.3** Update architecture diagram to match actual structure
- [ ] **6.4** Fix example code to use correct APIs
- [ ] **6.5** Document which MCP clients are actually implemented

## ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority Tasks (Quality improvements)

### 7. Environment and Development Experience
**Issue**: Minor setup issues identified
**Impact**: Slower developer onboarding

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **7.1** Upgrade Python requirement documentation (3.11+ needed)
- [ ] **7.2** Improve MCP server directory structure
- [ ] **7.3** Add automated dependency checking to quick-start script
- [ ] **7.4** Create development workflow documentation
- [ ] **7.5** Add troubleshooting for common setup issues

### 8. Remaining TODO Comments
**Issue**: Non-critical TODOs throughout codebase
**Impact**: Technical debt accumulation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **8.1** Implement event metrics integration
- [ ] **8.2** Add service bootstrap retry logic
- [ ] **8.3** Create event projection tables
- [ ] **8.4** Implement analytics database export
- [ ] **8.5** Add migration rollback support

### 9. Performance and Monitoring
**Issue**: Some monitoring features commented out
**Impact**: Reduced observability in production

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **9.1** Enable commented-out metrics collection
- [ ] **9.2** Add performance benchmarks for critical paths
- [ ] **9.3** Implement distributed tracing for all services
- [ ] **9.4** Create Grafana dashboards for new metrics
- [ ] **9.5** Add alerting rules for production monitoring

## ðŸ“Š Task Summary by Priority

### Must Complete Before Production (13 tasks)
- Customer Support Implementations: 5 tasks
- Knowledge Graph Parsing: 5 tasks
- Test Compilation Fixes: 5 tasks

### Should Complete Soon (21 tasks)
- Service Bootstrap: 5 tasks
- Test Coverage: 5 tasks
- Documentation: 5 tasks
- Environment Setup: 5 tasks

### Nice to Have (10 tasks)
- TODO Cleanup: 5 tasks
- Performance Monitoring: 5 tasks

**Total Remaining Tasks: 44**

## Recommended Approach

1. **Week 1**: Focus on critical blockers (tasks 1-3)
   - Fix test compilation first to enable CI/CD
   - Implement customer support tools with real API calls
   - Complete knowledge graph parsing

2. **Week 2**: Address high-priority items (tasks 4-6)
   - Create service bootstrap system
   - Add missing test coverage
   - Update documentation

3. **Week 3**: Quality improvements (tasks 7-9)
   - Enhance developer experience
   - Clean up remaining TODOs
   - Improve monitoring

## Success Criteria

**Production Ready When:**
- [ ] All tests compile and pass (298 tests)
- [ ] Customer support tools return real data
- [ ] Knowledge graph queries execute successfully
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 80% for critical paths
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects implementation
- [ ] No critical TODOs in production code paths

## Notes

- Agent 4 tasks (database and event infrastructure) are still pending
- Agent 5 tasks (production deployment and QA) depend on completing these items
- Consider feature flags for partially complete features
- Prioritize based on user-facing impact
