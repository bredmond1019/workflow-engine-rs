# Agent Tasks: Content Processing Service Documentation

## Agent Role

You are Agent 1 responsible for documenting the Content Processing Service. Your primary focus is creating comprehensive documentation for the high-performance document analysis microservice.

## Key Requirements

1. Create clear, practical documentation that helps developers understand and use the service
2. Include real code examples from the actual implementation
3. Document all API endpoints with curl examples
4. Explain the WASM plugin system with examples
5. Cover all document formats and analysis capabilities

## Your Tasks

### 1. Create Main Service README
**File:** `services/content_processing/README.md`
- [x] Service overview and purpose
- [x] Quick start guide with Docker
- [x] Feature list and capabilities
- [x] Technology stack overview
- [x] Development setup instructions

### 2. Document Architecture
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] System architecture diagram (mermaid)
- [x] Component breakdown (API, processors, plugins)
- [x] Database schema and migrations
- [x] Redis caching strategy
- [x] WASM plugin architecture

### 3. Create API Reference
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/API.md`
- [x] POST /analyze - Document analysis endpoint
- [x] GET /health - Health check endpoint
- [x] GET /metrics - Prometheus metrics
- [x] Request/response formats with examples
- [x] Error codes and handling

### 4. Document Data Models
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/DATA_MODELS.md`
- [x] AnalysisRequest structure
- [x] AnalysisResult structure
- [x] Document format specifications
- [x] Analysis feature types
- [x] Database models and relationships

### 5. Write Plugin Development Guide
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/PLUGINS.md`
- [x] WASM plugin interface
- [x] Creating custom processors
- [x] Plugin deployment and management
- [x] Example plugin implementation
- [x] Performance considerations

### 6. Create Configuration Guide
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- [x] Environment variables
- [x] Database configuration
- [x] Redis settings
- [x] Performance tuning options
- [x] Security settings

### 7. Write Deployment Guide
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- [x] Docker deployment
- [x] Kubernetes manifests
- [x] Database setup and migrations
- [x] Monitoring setup
- [x] Production best practices

### 8. Create Troubleshooting Guide
**File:** `services/content_processing/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- [x] Common issues and solutions
- [x] Performance debugging
- [x] Log analysis tips
- [x] Health check failures
- [x] Plugin loading issues

## Relevant Files to Reference

- `services/content_processing/src/lib.rs` - Main service code
- `services/content_processing/src/api/` - API endpoints
- `services/content_processing/src/processors/` - Document processors
- `services/content_processing/src/plugins/` - Plugin system
- `services/content_processing/src/models.rs` - Data models
- `services/content_processing/migrations/` - Database schema
- `services/content_processing/Dockerfile` - Container setup

## Dependencies

- No dependencies on other documentation agents
- Can work independently and in parallel

## Success Criteria

1. Complete documentation covers all 8 sections
2. All code examples compile and work
3. API documentation includes working curl examples
4. Plugin guide includes a complete example
5. Deployment guide is production-ready

## Process

For each documentation task:
1. Review the relevant source code
2. Extract key information and patterns
3. Write clear, concise documentation
4. Include practical examples
5. Test any code snippets or commands
6. Mark task complete with [x]

## Notes

- Focus on practical usage over theory
- Include performance characteristics where relevant
- Document any limitations or known issues
- Ensure consistency with Rust documentation standards
- Reference the main system where appropriate
