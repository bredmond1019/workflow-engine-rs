# Agent A Tasks: Content Processing Service Implementation

## Agent Role

You are Agent A responsible for implementing the Content Processing Service business logic. Your primary focus is replacing hardcoded API responses with real content analysis functionality.

## Your Tasks

### Task 2.1: Implement Content Processing Service API

- [x] **2.1.1 Replace hardcoded response in `services/content_processing/src/api.rs`**
  - [x] Remove the hardcoded JSON response
  - [x] Implement actual content processing logic
  - [x] Connect to the processor module
  - [x] Return real analysis results

- [x] **2.1.2 Implement content analysis algorithms in `src/processor.rs`**
  - [x] Create document parser for multiple formats (HTML, Markdown, PDF, JSON, XML)
  - [x] Implement text extraction pipelines
  - [x] Add language detection (with whatlang integration)
  - [x] Build text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization)

- [x] **2.1.3 Add AI model integration for content understanding**
  - [x] Integrate with existing AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - [x] Implement content summarization using AI
  - [x] Add sentiment analysis via AI models
  - [x] Create entity extraction using AI

- [x] **2.1.4 Implement quality assessment and scoring logic**
  - [x] Build readability score calculator (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
  - [x] Implement content complexity analysis
  - [x] Add grammar and spelling quality checks
  - [x] Create overall quality score algorithm

- [x] **2.1.5 Add content categorization and metadata extraction**
  - [x] Implement automatic categorization based on content
  - [x] Extract metadata (author, date, keywords)
  - [x] Build entity recognition (people, places, organizations)
  - [x] Add custom taxonomy support

- [x] **2.1.6 Implement proper error handling and validation**
  - [x] Add input validation for all content types
  - [x] Implement graceful error handling
  - [x] Create meaningful error messages
  - [x] Add retry logic for AI provider failures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Processing Pipeline
1. Set up basic document parsing infrastructure
2. Replace hardcoded API response with real processing
3. Implement text extraction for all formats
4. Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: AI Integration
1. Connect to existing AI provider clients
2. Implement AI-powered analysis features
3. Add fallback mechanisms for AI failures
4. Optimize for performance and cost

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement quality scoring algorithms
2. Add metadata extraction
3. Build categorization system
4. Complete testing and optimization

## Key Files to Modify

- `services/content_processing/src/api.rs` - Replace hardcoded responses
- `services/content_processing/src/processor.rs` - Core processing logic
- `services/content_processing/src/lib.rs` - Update types and interfaces
- `services/content_processing/src/models.rs` - Data structures
- `services/content_processing/tests/` - Add comprehensive tests

## Technical Requirements

### Content Type Support
- **HTML**: Full parsing with structure preservation
- **Markdown**: Complete CommonMark support
- **PDF**: Text extraction with layout awareness
- **JSON**: Structured data analysis
- **XML**: Schema-aware processing
- **Plain Text**: Direct analysis

### Analysis Features
- **Text Statistics**: Word count, sentence count, readability
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language identification
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive/negative/neutral classification
- **Entity Extraction**: People, places, organizations, dates
- **Keyword Extraction**: TF-IDF based keyword identification
- **Summary Generation**: AI-powered summarization
- **Quality Scoring**: Comprehensive quality metrics

### Integration Points
- Use existing AI providers from main system
- Follow WorkflowError patterns for errors
- Implement proper logging and metrics
- Support streaming for large documents

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Unit tests for each processing algorithm
- [x] Integration tests with AI providers
- [x] Performance tests for large documents
- [x] Error handling tests
- [x] Format-specific parsing tests

## Success Criteria

1. API returns real analysis results, not hardcoded data
2. All supported formats parse correctly
3. AI integration works with fallbacks
4. Quality scores are accurate and meaningful
5. Performance meets requirements (<500ms for typical documents)
6. All tests pass with >80% coverage

## Dependencies

- PostgreSQL with SQLx for persistence
- Existing AI provider clients
- Document parsing libraries (add to Cargo.toml as needed)

## Notes

- Follow existing code patterns from the main system
- Use async/await consistently
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Document all public APIs
- Consider memory usage for large documents
