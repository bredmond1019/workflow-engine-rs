# Agent Y: Token Pricing and Cost Management Tasks

## Mission
Complete token pricing and cost management system for all AI providers

## Task Progress

### 3.2.1 Implement cost calculation logic in `src/core/ai/tokens/pricing.rs`
- [x] Review existing pricing implementation
- [x] Enhance cost calculation with real-time integration
- [x] Add support for streaming cost tracking
- [x] Implement cost calculation for partial token usage
- [x] Add volume discount calculations
- [x] Create unit tests for pricing calculations

### 3.2.2 Add provider-specific pricing integration
- [x] Implement OpenAI pricing API integration framework
- [x] Implement Anthropic pricing updates framework
- [x] Implement AWS Bedrock pricing integration framework
- [x] Add pricing refresh mechanisms
- [x] Handle pricing API failures gracefully

### 3.2.3 Implement budget tracking and alerts
- [x] Review existing budget limits implementation
- [x] Create budget.rs module with real-time tracking
- [x] Implement alert threshold monitoring
- [x] Add notification system integration
- [x] Create budget dashboard endpoints structure

### 3.2.4 Add cost reporting and analytics
- [x] Review existing analytics implementation
- [x] Add cost optimization recommendations
- [x] Implement trend analysis
- [x] Add cost forecasting improvements
- [x] Create cost breakdown visualizations

### 3.2.5 Implement usage limits and throttling
- [x] Review existing limits implementation
- [x] Add real-time throttling based on costs
- [x] Implement gradual throttling mechanisms
- [x] Add integration with streaming for live throttling
- [x] Create throttling override mechanisms

## Integration Points

### StreamMetadata Interface (from Agent X)
```rust
pub struct StreamMetadata {
    pub model: String,
    pub provider: String,
    pub token_count: Option<u32>,
    pub total_tokens: Option<u32>,
    pub processing_time_ms: Option<u64>,
}
```

### Required Interface for Agent X
- Cost limits interface for streaming throttling
- Real-time cost tracking during streaming
- Budget violation callbacks

## Success Criteria
- [x] Accurate cost calculation for all supported models
- [x] Real-time budget tracking with immediate alerts
- [x] Cost analytics with actionable insights
- [x] Usage limits prevent budget overruns
- [x] Integration with Agent X streaming provides live cost tracking

## Implementation Summary

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Enhanced Pricing Engine** (`pricing.rs`)
   - Real-time cost calculation for streaming requests via `StreamMetadata`
   - Volume discount calculations with multiple tiers
   - Provider-specific pricing refresh mechanisms
   - Cost per token calculations for quick estimates
   - Model comparison and savings analysis

2. **Comprehensive Budget Tracking** (`budget.rs`)
   - Multi-scope budgets (global, provider, user, project)
   - Real-time spending tracking with automatic period resets
   - Alert thresholds with multiple notification channels
   - Budget status monitoring with health indicators
   - Streaming cost integration for live budget updates

3. **Advanced Cost Analytics** (`analytics.rs`)
   - Cost optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
   - Detailed cost breakdown analysis with trends
   - Monthly reporting with insights and comparisons
   - Usage efficiency analysis and batch opportunity detection
   - Provider and model cost driver identification

4. **Intelligent Throttling System** (`limits.rs`)
   - Real-time throttling decisions based on budget proximity
   - Dynamic throttling calculations for cost trajectory
   - Streaming-aware throttling for live request control
   - Emergency override mechanisms for critical situations
   - Gradual throttling to maintain service availability

### Integration with Agent X Streaming

- **StreamMetadata Processing**: Direct cost calculation from streaming chunks
- **Real-time Budget Updates**: Live tracking during streaming sessions
- **Throttling Interface**: Immediate throttling decisions for streaming requests
- **Cost Limits**: Budget violation prevention during active streams

### API Interfaces for Coordination

- `PricingEngine::calculate_streaming_cost(metadata: &StreamMetadata)`
- `BudgetTracker::record_streaming_cost(metadata: &StreamMetadata, cost: &CostBreakdown)`
- `BudgetLimits::check_streaming_throttle(metadata: &StreamMetadata)`
- `ThrottleDecision` enum for streaming control decisions
