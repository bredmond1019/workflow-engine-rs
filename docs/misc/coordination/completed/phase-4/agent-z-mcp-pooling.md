# Agent Z - MCP Connection Pooling Tasks

## Mission
Complete MCP connection pooling with health monitoring and load balancing

## Task Progress

### 3.3.1 Finish connection pool implementation (currently 40% complete) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Review current connection pool structure
- [x] Fix connection reuse mechanism (implemented BorrowedConnection pattern)
- [x] Improve connection lifecycle management (async-aware PooledConnection)
- [x] Add proper connection borrowing/returning patterns (auto-return on Drop)
- [x] Test connection pool under concurrent load

### 3.3.2 Add connection health monitoring and recovery ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Integrate health monitoring with connection pool operations
- [x] Add automatic connection recovery on failure
- [x] Implement connection validation before reuse
- [x] Add health-based connection selection
- [x] Add dedicated health check background task

### 3.3.3 Implement load balancing across MCP servers ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create load_balancer.rs module
- [x] Implement round-robin load balancing
- [x] Implement least-connections load balancing
- [x] Implement health-based load balancing
- [x] Add load balancer integration to connection pool
- [x] Implement advanced load balancer with server priorities and client affinity

### 3.3.4 Add connection metrics and monitoring ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Complete metrics integration with pool operations
- [x] Add connection-specific metrics tracking
- [x] Implement real-time metrics updates
- [x] Add load balancing metrics
- [x] Integration with existing Prometheus metrics system

## Current Status ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETED
- Connection pool implements proper connection reuse with BorrowedConnection pattern
- Health monitoring fully integrated with automated recovery
- Load balancing implemented with multiple strategies (round-robin, least-connections, health-based)
- Metrics automatically updated from all pool operations
- Production-ready MCP connection pooling system

## Key Achievements
1. ✅ Fixed connection reuse with async-aware BorrowedConnection pattern
2. ✅ Integrated health monitoring with automatic connection validation and recovery
3. ✅ Implemented comprehensive load balancing with server priorities and client affinity
4. ✅ Complete metrics integration with Prometheus monitoring
5. ✅ Production-ready connection lifecycle management
6. ✅ Background tasks for health monitoring, cleanup, and recovery

## Implementation Summary

### Connection Pool Architecture
- **BorrowedConnection**: Smart wrapper that automatically returns connections to pool on drop
- **PooledConnection**: Async-aware connection with health tracking and usage metrics
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Complete lifecycle management from creation to cleanup
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations with proper async/await support

### Health Monitoring Integration
- **Active Health Checks**: Periodic validation of connection health
- **Automatic Recovery**: Failed connection detection and replacement
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Coordinated with existing circuit breaker system
- **Health-based Selection**: Load balancer considers connection health

### Load Balancing Strategies
- **Round-Robin**: Fair distribution across available connections
- **Least-Connections**: Routes to connections with lowest usage
- **Health-Based**: Weighted selection based on connection health and performance
- **Advanced Features**: Server priorities, client affinity, dynamic weight adjustment

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Connection Metrics**: Request latency, success rates, pool utilization
- **Health Metrics**: Health check statistics, recovery attempts
- **Load Balancing Metrics**: Distribution patterns, server performance
- **Prometheus Integration**: Real-time metrics export for monitoring dashboards
