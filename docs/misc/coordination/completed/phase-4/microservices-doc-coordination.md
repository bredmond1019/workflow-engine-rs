# Multi-Agent Coordination: Microservices Documentation

## Agent Overview

### Agent Count: 3

**Rationale:** Each microservice has distinct functionality and technology that requires specialized documentation. The 3-agent structure allows focused, parallel documentation efforts while maintaining consistency across services.

### Agent Roles

1. **Agent 1 - Content Processing Service Documentation:** Document the content analysis and plugin system
2. **Agent 2 - Knowledge Graph Service Documentation:** Document the graph database and learning path functionality
3. **Agent 3 - Realtime Communication Service Documentation:** Document the WebSocket server and actor model

## Task Distribution Summary

### Documentation Goals

Each agent will create comprehensive documentation including:
- Service overview and architecture
- API reference with endpoints and examples
- Data models and schemas
- Configuration guide
- Deployment instructions
- Performance characteristics
- Integration patterns
- Troubleshooting guide

### Agent Task Breakdown

- **Agent 1:** Content Processing Service (8 documentation sections) ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Agent 2:** Knowledge Graph Service (8 documentation sections) ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Agent 3:** Realtime Communication Service (8 documentation sections) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Total:** 24 documentation sections across 3 microservices ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**

## Critical Dependencies

### Parallel Opportunities

All agents can work simultaneously as each microservice is independent. There are no blocking dependencies between documentation efforts.

### Shared Standards

- Use consistent documentation structure across all services
- Follow Rust documentation conventions
- Include mermaid diagrams for architecture visualization
- Provide curl/HTTP examples for all endpoints
- Document environment variables and configuration

## Communication Protocol

### Coordination Points

1. **Initial Sync:** Agree on documentation template and standards
2. **Mid-point Review:** Share progress and ensure consistency
3. **Final Integration:** Review cross-service references and dependencies

### Deliverables

Each agent produces:
1. `services/{service_name}/README.md` - Main service documentation
2. `services/{service_name}/docs/API.md` - Detailed API reference
3. `services/{service_name}/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment guide
4. `services/{service_name}/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture details

## Documentation Template

```markdown
# Service Name

## Overview
Brief description of the service and its role in the system

## Architecture
Technical architecture with mermaid diagrams

## API Reference
Detailed endpoint documentation with examples

## Data Models
Schemas and data structures

## Configuration
Environment variables and settings

## Deployment
Production deployment instructions

## Performance
Benchmarks and optimization tips

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Completeness:** All sections documented for each service
2. **Clarity:** Documentation is clear and example-driven
3. **Consistency:** Uniform structure across all services
4. **Practicality:** Includes real-world usage examples
5. **Maintainability:** Easy to update as services evolve

## Timeline

### Day 1: Documentation Creation
- All agents work in parallel on their assigned services
- Follow the documentation template
- Include code examples from actual implementations

### Day 2: Review and Polish
- Cross-review documentation between agents
- Ensure consistency in terminology and format
- Add cross-references between services

## Notes

- Reference existing code review reports where available
- Include actual code snippets from implementations
- Document both HTTP and WebSocket endpoints where applicable
- Highlight integration points with the main workflow system
- Document any known limitations or TODOs
