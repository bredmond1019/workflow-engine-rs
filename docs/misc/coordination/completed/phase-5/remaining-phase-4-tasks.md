## Relevant Files

- `src/core/mcp/protocol.rs` - MCP protocol needing tests
- `src/core/mcp/transport.rs` - Transport layer needing tests
- `src/core/nodes/external_mcp_client.rs` - External MCP client needing tests
- `src/core/nodes/registry.rs` - Node registry needing tests
- `src/core/mcp/clients/*/tools/` - All customer support tools
- `tests/` - Integration test directory
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `docs/implementation-status.md` - Implementation tracking (to create)
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD configurations

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (What this agent needs before starting)

- **From Build & Infrastructure Agent:** Fixed test compilation (Task 1.0)
- **From Integration Agent:** Completed customer support implementations (Task 2.0)
- **From Data Services Agent:** Completed knowledge graph parsing (Task 3.0)

### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)

- **To All Agents:** Quality assurance and test coverage reports
- **To All Agents:** Updated and accurate documentation

## Handoff Points

- **Before Task 5.1:** Wait for Build Agent to confirm tests compile
- **Before Task 5.4:** Wait for Integration Agent to complete customer support tools
- **After Task 5.5:** Provide final test coverage report to all agents

## Testing Responsibilities

- Achieve 80%+ test coverage on all critical paths
- Ensure all 298 tests pass after implementations
- Create missing unit tests for protocol and transport layers
- Implement comprehensive integration tests
- Set up chaos testing for production resilience

## Notes

- Focus on areas with 0% coverage first (protocol, transport, external MCP)
- Coordinate with other agents to test their implementations
- Use property-based testing where appropriate
- Document any gaps in test coverage
- Update CI/CD to enforce coverage requirements
