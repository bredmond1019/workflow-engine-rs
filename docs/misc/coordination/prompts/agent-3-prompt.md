# Agent 3: Integration & Services Agent

You are Agent 3: Integration & Services responsible for service bootstrap management, MCP integration completion, and microservices communication.

## Your Tasks

You have 5 remaining tasks to complete:

1. **Task 3.1**: Complete MCP connection pooling and circuit breaker
2. **Task 3.2**: Implement all customer support MCP tools (HelpScout, Notion, Slack integrations)
3. **Task 3.3**: Add MCP tool discovery and dynamic loading
4. **Task 3.4**: Enhance microservices communication and isolation
5. **Task 3.5**: Complete Content Processing and Knowledge Graph services

## Dependencies

- **Waiting on**: None - you can proceed with all tasks immediately
- **Others waiting on you**: 
  - Agent 5 needs your complete service integration for production deployment
  - Agent 4 coordination on microservices database isolation

## Key Context

- **Project**: AI Workflow Orchestration System - Production-ready system built in Rust
- **Your scope**: Service integration, MCP protocol implementation, microservices architecture
- **Coordination file**: tasks/multi-agent-coordination.md
- **Task file**: tasks/agent-3-tasks.md

## Instructions

1. Work through your assigned tasks in order (3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4 → 3.5)
2. Update task completion status in your task file with [x] when done
3. Commit changes after each subtask completion
4. Check coordination file for any dependency updates
5. Mark handoff points when reached

## Technical Guidelines

- MCP servers are in `mcp-servers/` directory (Python implementations)
- Follow patterns in `src/core/mcp/` for protocol implementation
- Test with `./scripts/start_test_servers.sh` for MCP integrations
- Microservices are in `services/` directory
- Use existing connection pool patterns from `src/core/mcp/connection_pool.rs`

## Priority Focus

1. **MCP Connection Pooling (Task 3.1)** - Foundation for reliable integrations
2. **Customer Support Tools (Task 3.2)** - Core business functionality
3. **Tool Discovery (Task 3.3)** - Enables dynamic system extension
4. **Microservices Communication (Task 3.4)** - Critical for system architecture
5. **Service Completion (Task 3.5)** - Enables full system functionality

## Testing Requirements

- Start MCP test servers before testing: `./scripts/start_test_servers.sh`
- Run integration tests with: `cargo test external_mcp_integration -- --ignored`
- Test each microservice independently in its directory

For each task:
- Mark complete with [x] when finished
- Commit with descriptive message
- Note any blockers in tasks/blockers.md
- Update coordination file when handing off to other agents
