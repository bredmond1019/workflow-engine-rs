## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (What this agent needs before starting)

- **From Agent 1:** Working compilation environment and database connectivity
- **External Dependencies:** PostgreSQL instance, Redis for event caching
- **Schema Setup:** Database migrations and initial schema creation

### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)

- **To Agent 2:** Reliable event store for microservice persistence needs
- **To Agent 3:** Event infrastructure for MCP integration logging
- **To Agent 5:** Production-ready database architecture for deployment

## Handoff Points

- **After Task 4.1:** Notify Agent 2 that event store is ready for service integration
- **After Task 4.2:** Confirm database isolation is ready for multi-tenant deployment
- **After Task 4.3:** Signal that event-driven architecture is production-ready
- **Before Task 4.3.2:** Wait for Agent 2's services to be generating events

## Testing Responsibilities

- Unit tests for all event store operations (create, read, replay)
- Integration tests with PostgreSQL database
- Performance testing for high-volume event processing
- Multi-tenancy testing for data isolation verification
- Event ordering and deduplication testing under concurrent load

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Complete Event Store Core (Week 1)
1. **PostgreSQL Implementation** (Task 4.1.1)
   - Complete concrete event store operations
   - Implement JSONB event serialization
   - Add optimistic concurrency control

2. **Event Replay** (Task 4.1.2)
   - Event stream reconstruction
   - Point-in-time state recovery
   - Efficient event filtering and querying

### Phase 2: Advanced Event Features (Week 2)
1. **Snapshots and Versioning** (Tasks 4.1.3-4.1.4)
   - Snapshot creation and restoration logic
   - Event schema versioning and migration
   - Backward compatibility maintenance

2. **Service Isolation** (Tasks 4.2.1-4.2.4)
   - Multi-tenant database architecture
   - Service-level permission systems
   - Connection pooling per microservice

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Architecture (Week 3)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Event Store Architecture
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL with JSONB for event data
- **Indexing:** Composite indexes on aggregate_id, version, timestamp
- **Concurrency:** Optimistic locking with version checks
- **Performance:** Batch operations, connection pooling, query optimization

### Service Isolation Strategy
- **Database Per Service:** Each microservice has isolated database access
- **Tenant Isolation:** Row-level security for multi-tenant data
- **Connection Management:** Service-specific connection pools
- **Permissions:** Least-privilege database access per service

### Event-Driven Synchronization
- **Event Bus:** Redis pub/sub for event distribution
- **Saga Orchestration:** Long-running transaction coordination
- **Event Ordering:** Timestamp-based ordering with conflict resolution
- **Error Handling:** Dead letter queues, retry policies, circuit breakers

## Database Schema Requirements

### Event Store Tables
```sql
-- Events table with JSONB data
CREATE TABLE events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(aggregate_id, version)
);

-- Snapshots table for performance
CREATE TABLE snapshots (
    aggregate_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Service Isolation Schema
```sql
-- Tenant management
CREATE TABLE tenants (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Service-specific permissions
CREATE TABLE service_permissions (
    service_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
    permissions JSONB NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(service_name, tenant_id)
);
```

## Performance Targets

- **Event Write Latency:** < 10ms for single event insert
- **Event Replay Performance:** < 100ms for 1000 events
- **Concurrent Connections:** Support 100+ simultaneous service connections
- **Event Throughput:** Handle 10,000+ events per second
- **Query Performance:** < 50ms for aggregate state reconstruction

## Notes

- Use existing database models in `src/db/models/` as foundation
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices for JSONB indexing and querying
- Coordinate with Agent 2 for service integration testing
- Ensure all database operations are transactional and ACID compliant
- Document database setup and migration procedures for Agent 5
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting for database health
