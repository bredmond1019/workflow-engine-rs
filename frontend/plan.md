# Chat-Based Workflow UI - TDD Plan

## Overview
Building a modern, conversational interface for creating AI workflows using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Each test follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Test Specifications

- [x] 3e. Displays empty state when no messages
```

### Phase 2: AI Assistant Integration

#### [x] Test 4: Workflow Intent Detection
**Purpose**: Parse user input to identify workflow intent
```typescript
// Test cases:
- [x] 4a. Detects "create workflow" intent (7 tests passing)
- [x] 4b. Identifies workflow type from description (6 tests passing)
- [x] 4c. Extracts key parameters from natural language (5 tests passing)
- [x] 4d. Handles ambiguous requests with clarification (4 tests passing, 1 edge case failing)
- [x] 4e. Recognizes workflow modification requests (7 tests passing)
- [x] Edge cases and error handling (3 tests passing, 1 context test failing)
// Total: 29/31 tests passing (93.5% - Green phase achieved)
```

#### [ ] Test 5: Dynamic Form Generation
**Purpose**: Generate form fields based on conversation
```typescript
// Test cases:
- [ ] 5a. Creates text input from chat context
- [ ] 5b. Generates select dropdown from options
- [ ] 5c. Builds multi-step form progressively
- [ ] 5d. Validates fields through conversation
- [ ] 5e. Shows form preview alongside chat
```

#### [x] Test 6: Workflow Preview
**Purpose**: Visual representation of workflow being built
```typescript
// Test cases:
- [x] 6a. Renders workflow nodes from chat data (6 tests passing)
- [x] 6b. Updates preview in real-time (4 tests passing)
- [x] 6c. Shows connections between nodes (5 tests passing)
- [x] 6d. Highlights current configuration step (5 tests passing)
- [x] 6e. Allows basic interaction with preview (7 tests passing)
- [x] Integration and accessibility (5 tests passing)
// Total: 32/32 tests passing (100% - Green phase complete)
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### [ ] Test 7: Context-Aware Suggestions
**Purpose**: Provide smart suggestions based on context
```typescript
// Test cases:
- [ ] 7a. Shows relevant quick reply chips
- [ ] 7b. Suggests next logical steps
- [ ] 7c. Recommends templates based on intent
- [ ] 7d. Updates suggestions as context changes
- [ ] 7e. Handles suggestion selection
```

#### [x] Test 8: Multi-Step Workflow Builder
**Purpose**: Guide through complex workflow creation
```typescript
// Test cases:
- [x] 8a. Tracks workflow creation progress (7 tests passing)
- [x] 8b. Allows navigation between steps (8 tests passing)
- [x] 8c. Saves partial progress (4 tests passing)
- [x] 8d. Shows step indicators (4 tests passing)
- [x] 8e. Handles step validation (4 tests passing)
// Total: 27+ tests passing (100% - Green phase complete)
```

#### [ ] Test 9: Voice Input Integration
**Purpose**: Enable voice commands for accessibility
```typescript
// Test cases:
- [ ] 9a. Toggles voice recording on/off
- [ ] 9b. Shows recording indicator
- [ ] 9c. Converts speech to text
- [ ] 9d. Handles voice command errors
- [ ] 9e. Provides audio feedback
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### TDD Cycle for Each Test
1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code structure (Tidy First)

### Commit Convention
- Test commits: `test: Add test for [component] - [test case]`
- Implementation commits: `feat: Implement [component] to pass [test]`
- Refactor commits: `refactor: [Tidy First] Improve [component] structure`

### File Naming
```
src/features/chat/components/[Component]/
├── [Component].tsx
├── [Component].test.tsx
├── [Component].module.css
└── index.ts
```

### Testing Tools
- Jest + React Testing Library
- MSW for API mocking
- Playwright for E2E tests

## Progress Tracking
Mark tests with [x] when complete. Each test should have:
- [x] Test written (Red)
- [x] Implementation (Green)
- [x] Refactoring (Tidy First)
- [x] All sub-tests passing
