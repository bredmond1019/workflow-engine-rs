# Open Source Release Preparation Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Documentation Review and Updates

#### Created New Documentation Files:
- **DEV_SETUP.md**: Comprehensive development environment setup guide with:
  - System requirements and prerequisites
  - Step-by-step installation instructions
  - Database setup procedures
  - Testing commands and strategies
  - Debugging tips and troubleshooting
  - Common development tasks

- **project-open-source.md**: Project readiness status tracking:
  - Critical issues to fix before release
  - Documentation issues identified
  - Code quality assessment
  - Pre-release checklist
  - Release readiness assessment

- **unfinished-tasks.md**: Comprehensive list of:
  - Stubbed functions and their locations
  - Incomplete implementations
  - Missing features referenced in documentation
  - Priority levels for completion

#### Updated Existing Documentation:
- **README.md**:
  - Updated installation instructions to reflect source-only availability
  - Removed references to non-existent MCP servers
  - Updated service ports to match actual configuration
  - Added "Current Status & Roadmap" section
  - Clarified which features are implemented vs planned
  - Fixed example code to use actual components

- **QUICK_START.md**:
  - Fixed binary name from `backend` to `workflow-engine`
  - Updated repository URL and directory names
  - Removed references to non-existent `dev.sh` script
  - Updated database setup commands
  - Fixed crate version references

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Failing Tests (HIGH PRIORITY)
- 2 failing tests in `workflow-engine-mcp`:
  - `config::tests::test_customer_support_server_config`
  - `config::tests::test_external_server_config`
- **Action Required**: Fix these before release

### 2. Missing Implementations
- **Registry API Endpoints**: All return 501 Not Implemented
  - `register_agent`, `list_agents`, `discover_agents`, `heartbeat_agent`
- **WASM Plugin Support**: Documented but not implemented
- **MCP Example Servers**: Referenced but don't exist

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps
- `workflow-engine-app`: 0 tests
- API routes: No test coverage for health, registry, auth endpoints
- Database migrations: No test coverage

## Documentation Discrepancies Fixed

1. **Frontend Directory**: Now documented as existing but not mentioned in original README
2. **Service Ports**: Updated to match actual configuration (3001, 3002, 3003)
3. **Binary Names**: Changed from `backend` to `workflow-engine`
4. **Database Setup**: Updated to use Diesel migrations instead of init-db.sql
5. **MCP Servers**: Clarified that example servers are not included

## Recommendations for Release

### Immediate Actions (Before Release):
1. Fix the 2 failing tests
2. Either implement or properly document registry endpoints as "planned"
3. Add basic tests for main binary and API routes
4. Update all example code to be runnable
5. Create at least one working example in `examples/` directory

### Documentation Actions:
1. ✅ Created DEV_SETUP.md
2. ✅ Updated README.md with accurate information
3. ✅ Fixed QUICK_START.md issues
4. ✅ Created tracking documents for incomplete work

### Code Actions Needed:
1. Fix failing MCP configuration tests
2. Add startup test for workflow-engine-app
3. Add basic API endpoint tests
4. Remove or properly stub incomplete features

## Project Status Summary

- **Core Functionality**: ~95% complete and working
- **Documentation**: Now accurate and comprehensive
- **Test Coverage**: Good for core, needs work for API and main app
- **Production Readiness**: Close, but needs the critical fixes above

## Estimated Time to Release

With the documentation updates completed:
- **Critical fixes only**: 1-2 days
- **Recommended improvements**: 3-5 days
- **Full polish**: 1-2 weeks

The project is very close to being ready for open source release. The main blockers are the 2 failing tests and the lack of test coverage for the main application entry point.
