## Purpose

These files are maintained for:

1. **Project History** - Tracking the evolution of the project and decisions made
2. **Internal Reference** - Information useful for maintainers but not for public users
3. **Development Context** - Understanding the development process and challenges
4. **Quality Assurance** - Records of reviews and testing performed

## Usage Guidelines

### For Project Maintainers
- These files provide context about project development
- Review reports can inform future development decisions
- Task tracking files help understand project evolution
- Setup reports document configuration decisions

### For Contributors
- Generally, these files are for reference only
- Focus on the main documentation in `docs/` for contribution guidance
- Some files may provide useful historical context

### For Users
- These files are not intended for end users
- Use the main documentation in `docs/` instead
- Refer to README.md, QUICK_START.md, and tutorial documentation

## Maintenance

### Adding Files
- Only add files that have internal value but shouldn't be in main documentation
- Include a brief description in this README when adding significant files
- Consider whether the content should be in `docs/` instead

### Cleaning Up
- Periodically review files for continued relevance
- Archive or remove files that are no longer useful
- Avoid accumulating too many outdated artifacts

### File Types Appropriate for misc/
- Internal reports and reviews
- Development logs and test outputs
- Planning documents and checklists
- Duplicate or superseded documentation
- Project management artifacts

### File Types That Should Be Elsewhere
- User-facing documentation → `docs/`
- Component implementation guides → component CLAUDE.md files
- API documentation → OpenAPI specs and component docs
- Setup and deployment guides → `docs/development/` or `docs/deployment/`

This organization keeps the main project clean and professional while preserving valuable internal project information.
