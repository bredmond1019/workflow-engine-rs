// GraphQL resolvers for Knowledge Graph service
// This module contains the business logic for resolving GraphQL queries and mutations

use crate::service::KnowledgeGraphService;
use crate::graph::{Concept as DomainConcept};
use super::schema::{Concept, DifficultyLevel};

// Resolver implementations would go here
// These would call the KnowledgeGraphService methods and convert domain types to GraphQL types
