### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)
- **To All Agents:** Comprehensive testing framework and documentation
- **To Community:** Excellent developer onboarding experience
- **To Project:** Quality assurance and release readiness validation

## Handoff Points

- **After Task 5.1:** Notify all agents that test framework is ready for their testing needs
- **After Task 6.1:** Notify Core Features Agent that performance documentation template is ready
- **After Task 6.3:** Notify all agents that README examples are updated and can be referenced
- **Before Task 6.4:** Wait for Architecture Cleanup Agent to complete documentation updates (Task 2.4)

## Testing Responsibilities

- **Primary responsibility:** Get 90%+ of 1,594 tests passing
- Integration testing coordination with all other agents
- End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- Demo workflow validation and reliability testing
- Documentation example validation (ensure all examples work)

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Start with Task 5.1** - Fix test compilation (foundation for all testing)
2. **Continue with Task 5.2-5.3** - Create reliable test infrastructure
3. **Parallel with Task 6.1-6.2** - Create foundational documentation
4. **Follow with Task 5.4-5.5** - Comprehensive test coverage
5. **Finish with Tasks 6.3-6.4 and 9.0** - Polish documentation and demos

## Critical Success Criteria

- [ ] **90%+ tests passing** (target: >1400 of 1594 tests)
- [ ] **All documentation links work** (no broken references)
- [ ] **README examples compile and run** (verified working code)
- [ ] **Demo workflows work reliably** (customer support demo functional)
- [ ] **Developer setup documentation complete** (new contributors can onboard easily)

## Quality Gates

### Test Quality Gate
- [ ] Test compilation: `cargo test --no-run` succeeds
- [ ] Basic tests: `cargo test` achieves 90%+ pass rate
- [ ] Integration tests: `cargo test -- --ignored` runs successfully
- [ ] Demo tests: Customer support workflow tests pass

### Documentation Quality Gate
- [ ] All referenced files exist and are accessible
- [ ] All code examples compile: `cargo check --examples`
- [ ] All links resolve: automated link checking passes
- [ ] Documentation covers all major features accurately

### Demo Quality Gate
- [ ] Customer support workflow runs end-to-end
- [ ] Rule-based implementations produce expected outputs
- [ ] Tutorial steps can be followed successfully
- [ ] Demo showcases core workflow engine capabilities

## Coordination Notes

- **With Build & Infrastructure Agent:** Coordinate test infrastructure requirements
- **With Architecture Cleanup Agent:** Integrate architectural documentation updates
- **With Core Features Agent:** Include benchmark results and configuration docs

## Notes

- **Focus on developer experience** - documentation should enable easy contribution
- **Test systematically** - work through ignored tests methodically with proper infrastructure
- **Validate everything** - all examples and links must work before release
- **Document decisions** - record why certain tests are ignored or why demos use specific approaches
- **Create comprehensive tutorials** - help users understand workflow engine capabilities through working examples
