- `src/core/mcp/clients/helpscout.rs` - HelpScout client implementation
- `src/core/mcp/clients/notion.rs` - Notion client implementation
- `src/core/mcp/clients/slack/tools/` - Slack tool implementations

- `src/core/mcp/clients/notion/tools/` - Notion tool implementations
- `src/core/mcp/connection_pool.rs` - MCP connection pooling
- `tests/slack_integration_test.rs` - Slack integration tests (to create)
- `tests/helpscout_integration_test.rs` - HelpScout integration tests (to create)

- `scripts/start_test_servers.sh` - Test server startup script

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (What this agent needs before starting)

- **From Build & Infrastructure Agent:** Fixed compilation errors (Task 1.0 complete)
- **From Build & Infrastructure Agent:** Bootstrap container available (Task 4.2)

### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)

- **To QA Agent:** Completed customer support integrations for testing
- **To All Agents:** Working MCP client implementations

## Handoff Points

- **Before Task 2.1:** Wait for confirmation from Build Agent that compilation is fixed
- **After Task 2.3:** Notify QA Agent that all three integrations are ready for testing
- **After Task 2.5:** Notify QA Agent that connection pooling verification is complete

## Testing Responsibilities

- Create comprehensive integration tests for each customer support tool
- Test with real MCP servers (requires running `./scripts/start_test_servers.sh`)
- Verify connection pooling and error handling work correctly
- Ensure no mock data remains in production code paths

## Notes

- Start with Slack integration as it may be the simplest
- Ensure all mock responses are completely replaced with real API calls
- Pay special attention to error handling and retry logic
- Test servers must be running for integration tests
- Coordinate with QA Agent for comprehensive testing coverage
