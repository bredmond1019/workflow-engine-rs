## Relevant Files

- `services/knowledge_graph/src/client/dgraph.rs` - Dgraph client with parsing methods
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/client/tests/` - Unit tests for Dgraph client
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/graph.rs` - Graph operations logic
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/api.rs` - Knowledge graph API endpoints
- `services/knowledge_graph/tests/graph_tests.rs` - Graph operation tests
- `tests/knowledge_graph_tests.rs` - Integration tests for knowledge graph
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker configuration for Dgraph
- `services/knowledge_graph/dgraph/` - Dgraph configuration files

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (What this agent needs before starting)

- **From Build & Infrastructure Agent:** Fixed compilation errors (Task 1.0 complete)
- **From Build & Infrastructure Agent:** Configuration management system (Task 4.4)

### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)

- **To QA Agent:** Complete knowledge graph functionality for testing
- **To All Agents:** Working Dgraph integration

## Handoff Points

- **Before Task 3.1:** Wait for confirmation from Build Agent that compilation is fixed
- **After Task 3.2:** Notify QA Agent that parsing implementation is complete
- **After Task 3.5:** Notify QA Agent that integration tests are ready

## Testing Responsibilities

- Create comprehensive unit tests for all parsing methods
- Set up and maintain test Dgraph instance
- Create integration tests with real Dgraph queries
- Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly

## Notes

- Focus on getting basic query parsing working first
- Ensure all `unimplemented!()` calls are replaced
- Pay attention to GraphQL response structure variations
- Docker and Dgraph must be running for integration tests
- Consider performance implications for large result sets
