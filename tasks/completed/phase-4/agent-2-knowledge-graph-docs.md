# Agent Tasks: Knowledge Graph Service Documentation

## Agent Role

You are Agent 2 responsible for documenting the Knowledge Graph Service. Your primary focus is creating comprehensive documentation for the graph database microservice that manages concept relationships and learning paths.

## Key Requirements

1. Create clear documentation for graph operations and algorithms
2. Explain Dgraph integration and setup clearly
3. Document all GraphQL queries and mutations

- [x] Development setup instructions

### 2. Document Architecture
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] System architecture diagram (mermaid)
- [x] Dgraph cluster architecture
- [x] Connection pooling strategy
- [x] Caching layer design
- [x] Graph algorithm implementations

### 3. Create API Reference
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/API.md`
- [x] GraphQL schema documentation
- [x] REST endpoints for queries
- [x] Learning path generation API
- [x] Graph exploration endpoints
- [x] Request/response examples

### 4. Document Graph Schema
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/SCHEMA.md`
- [x] Node types and properties
- [x] Edge types and relationships
- [x] GraphQL type definitions
- [x] Index strategies
- [x] Schema evolution guide

### 5. Write Algorithms Guide
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/ALGORITHMS.md`
- [x] PageRank implementation
- [x] Shortest path algorithms
- [x] Topological sorting
- [x] Graph traversal patterns
- [x] Performance characteristics

### 6. Create Configuration Guide
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- [x] Environment variables
- [x] Dgraph connection settings
- [x] Redis configuration
- [x] Algorithm parameters
- [x] Performance tuning

### 7. Write Deployment Guide
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- [x] Dgraph cluster setup
- [x] Kubernetes deployment
- [x] Data backup strategies
- [x] Monitoring setup
- [x] Scaling considerations

### 8. Create Troubleshooting Guide
**File:** `services/knowledge_graph/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- [x] Common Dgraph issues
- [x] Query performance problems
- [x] Connection pool exhaustion
- [x] Graph consistency checks
- [x] Recovery procedures

## Relevant Files to Reference

- `services/knowledge_graph/src/lib.rs` - Main service code
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/client.rs` - Dgraph client
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/algorithms/` - Graph algorithms
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/queries/` - GraphQL queries
- `services/knowledge_graph/dgraph/` - Dgraph setup files
- `services/knowledge_graph/AGENT_C_REVIEW_REPORT.md` - Code review insights

## Dependencies

- No dependencies on other documentation agents
- Reference Dgraph official documentation where appropriate

## Success Criteria

1. Complete documentation covers all 8 sections
2. GraphQL examples are valid and tested
3. Algorithm explanations include visual diagrams
4. Deployment guide covers production Dgraph setup
5. Performance benchmarks are included

## Process

For each documentation task:
1. Review the source code and Dgraph setup
2. Understand the graph algorithms implementation
3. Write clear documentation with examples
4. Create visual diagrams for graph concepts
5. Test GraphQL queries and mutations
6. Mark task complete with [x]

## Notes

- Use mermaid for graph visualizations
- Include complexity analysis for algorithms
- Document Dgraph-specific optimizations
- Explain the learning path generation logic
- Reference the existing code review report
