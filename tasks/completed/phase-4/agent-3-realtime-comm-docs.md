# Agent Tasks: Realtime Communication Service Documentation

## Agent Role

You are Agent 3 responsible for documenting the Realtime Communication Service. Your primary focus is creating comprehensive documentation for the WebSocket-based messaging microservice with actor model architecture.

## Key Requirements

1. Document WebSocket protocol and message formats clearly
2. Explain the actor model architecture with examples
3. Cover authentication and authorization flows
4. Document scaling strategies for 10,000+ connections
5. Include client implementation examples

## Your Tasks

### 1. Create Main Service README
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/README.md`
- [x] Service overview and real-time capabilities
- [x] Quick start guide with WebSocket client
- [x] Feature list (messaging, presence, rooms)
- [x] Technology stack (Actix, actors, Redis)
- [x] Development setup instructions

### 2. Document Architecture
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] Actor model architecture diagram
- [x] WebSocket connection lifecycle
- [x] Message routing system
- [x] Session management design
- [x] Scaling architecture for high concurrency

### 3. Create Protocol Reference
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/PROTOCOL.md`
- [x] WebSocket message format
- [x] Command types and payloads
- [x] Authentication handshake
- [x] Error message format
- [x] Client implementation guide

### 4. Document API Reference
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/API.md`
- [x] WebSocket connection endpoint
- [x] REST endpoints for management
- [x] Health and metrics endpoints
- [x] Session management APIs
- [x] JavaScript/TypeScript client examples

### 5. Write Actor System Guide
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/ACTORS.md`
- [x] Actor types and responsibilities
- [x] Message passing patterns
- [x] Actor supervision strategies
- [x] State management in actors
- [x] Performance considerations

### 6. Create Configuration Guide
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- [x] Environment variables
- [x] JWT configuration
- [x] Redis connection settings
- [x] Rate limiting parameters
- [x] Circuit breaker settings

### 7. Write Deployment Guide
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- [x] WebSocket load balancing
- [x] Kubernetes StatefulSet setup
- [x] Redis cluster configuration
- [x] Monitoring WebSocket connections
- [x] Production scaling strategies

### 8. Create Troubleshooting Guide
**File:** `services/realtime_communication/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- [x] Connection issues
- [x] Message delivery problems
- [x] Actor system debugging
- [x] Performance bottlenecks
- [x] Client reconnection strategies

## Relevant Files to Reference

- `services/realtime_communication/src/lib.rs` - Main service code
- `services/realtime_communication/src/actors/` - Actor implementations
- `services/realtime_communication/src/websocket/` - WebSocket handlers
- `services/realtime_communication/src/session/` - Session management
- `services/realtime_communication/src/auth/` - Authentication
- `services/realtime_communication/AGENT_B_CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` - Code review insights

## Dependencies

- No dependencies on other documentation agents
- Can reference the main system's JWT implementation

## Success Criteria

1. Complete documentation covers all 8 sections
2. Protocol documentation enables client implementation
3. Actor model is clearly explained with diagrams
4. Scaling guide addresses 10,000+ connections
5. Includes working client examples

## Process

For each documentation task:
1. Review the source code and actor implementations
2. Understand the WebSocket protocol design
3. Write clear documentation with examples
4. Create sequence diagrams for message flows
5. Include client code examples
6. Mark task complete with [x]

## Notes

- Include WebSocket client examples in multiple languages
- Document the actor supervision tree
- Explain circuit breaker and rate limiting
- Cover reconnection and presence handling
- Reference the existing code review report
