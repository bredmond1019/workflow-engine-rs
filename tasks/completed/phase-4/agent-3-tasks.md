## Dependencies

### Prerequisites (What this agent needs before starting)

- **From Agent 1:** Working MCP client compilation and functional connection framework
- **From Agent 2:** Functional microservice APIs for integration testing
- **External Dependencies:** AI provider API keys and MCP Python servers running

### Provides to Others (What this agent delivers)

- **To Agent 2:** Complete AI integration capabilities for content processing
- **To Agent 4:** MCP connection pool for event-driven integrations
- **To Agent 5:** Production-ready AI streaming and cost management for deployment

## Handoff Points

- **After Task 3.1:** Notify Agent 2 that AI streaming is ready for service integration
- **After Task 3.2:** Confirm cost management is functional for Agent 5's production monitoring
- **After Task 3.3:** Signal that MCP connection pooling is ready for high-load production use
- **Before Task 3.1.4:** Wait for Agent 2's WebSocket infrastructure to be stable

## Testing Responsibilities

- Unit tests for all AI provider streaming implementations
- Integration testing with live AI provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock)

- **Providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS pricing APIs integration
- **Budgeting:** Per-user, per-project, and global budget tracking
- **Analytics:** Cost trends, usage patterns, optimization recommendations

### MCP Connection Pooling
- **Architecture:** Connection pool per MCP server type
- **Health Checks:** Periodic ping, connection validation, automatic recovery
- **Load Balancing:** Round-robin, least-connections, health-based routing
- **Monitoring:** Connection metrics, request/response tracking, error rates

### TODO Stub Areas to Complete
- **Customer Support Tools:** HelpScout, Slack, Notion MCP clients
- **Workflow Integration:** Event-driven workflow triggers and actions
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback

## Critical Success Criteria

1. **All AI providers stream responses in real-time without blocking**
2. **Token pricing accurately calculates costs for all supported models**
3. **MCP connection pool handles high concurrency without connection leaks**
4. **No TODO comments remain in production code paths**
5. **Integration tests pass with live AI provider APIs**
