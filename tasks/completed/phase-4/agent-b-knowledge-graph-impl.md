## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dgraph Integration
1. Set up Dgraph client and connection pool
2. Replace placeholder API responses
3. Implement basic query execution
4. Add error handling for connection issues

### Phase 2: Core Graph Operations
1. Implement graph traversal algorithms
2. Add CRUD operations for nodes/edges
3. Build relationship discovery
4. Create path finding algorithms

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add pagination and filtering
2. Implement caching strategies
3. Optimize query performance
4. Complete testing suite

## Key Files to Modify

- `services/knowledge_graph/src/api.rs` - Replace placeholder responses
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/client.rs` - Dgraph client implementation
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/graph.rs` - Graph algorithms
- `services/knowledge_graph/src/queries/` - GraphQL queries
- `services/knowledge_graph/tests/` - Comprehensive tests

## Technical Requirements

### Graph Operations
- **Node Management**: Create, read, update, delete nodes
- **Edge Management**: Create, read, update, delete relationships
- **Traversal**: BFS, DFS, shortest path, custom patterns
- **Queries**: GraphQL queries with filters and pagination
- **Mutations**: Atomic updates with transaction support
- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export large datasets

### Algorithm Implementations
- **PageRank**: Node importance calculation
- **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra and A* algorithms
- **Community Detection**: Identify clusters
- **Centrality Measures**: Betweenness, closeness
- **Pattern Matching**: Find specific graph patterns

### Dgraph Specifics
- Use Dgraph's GraphQL interface
- Implement proper schema management
- Handle distributed queries
- Support facets on edges
- Manage indexes efficiently

## Testing Requirements

- [x] Unit tests for all algorithms
- [x] Integration tests with Dgraph
- [x] Performance tests for large graphs
- [x] Query optimization tests
- [x] Transaction and concurrency tests

## Success Criteria

1. API returns real graph data from Dgraph
2. All graph algorithms work correctly
3. CRUD operations are atomic and consistent
4. Query performance is optimized
5. Pagination works for large result sets
6. All tests pass with >80% coverage

## Dependencies

- Dgraph instance (use Docker for development)
- GraphQL client library
- Redis for query result caching
- Existing error handling patterns

## Dgraph Setup

```bash
# Start Dgraph for development
cd services/knowledge_graph/dgraph
docker-compose up -d

# Dgraph will be available at:
# - Alpha: http://localhost:8080
# - Ratel UI: http://localhost:8000
```

## Example Queries

```graphql
# Find all related concepts
query RelatedConcepts($id: ID!) {
  getNode(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    related {
      id
      name
      relationship_type
    }
  }
}

# Create a new concept
mutation CreateConcept($input: ConceptInput!) {
  addConcept(input: $input) {
    concept {
      id
      name
      created_at
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

- Follow Dgraph best practices for schema design
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Consider graph size in algorithm choice
