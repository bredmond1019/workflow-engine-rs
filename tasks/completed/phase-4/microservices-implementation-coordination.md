# Multi-Agent Coordination: Microservices Business Logic Implementation

## Agent Overview

### Agent Count: 3

**Rationale:** Each microservice has independent business logic that can be implemented in parallel. The 3-agent structure allows focused implementation while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Agent Roles

1. **Agent A - Content Processing Service:** Implement content analysis algorithms and AI integration
2. **Agent B - Knowledge Graph Service:** Implement graph operations and Dgraph integration  
3. **Agent C - Realtime Communication Service:** Implement WebSocket messaging and session management

## Task Distribution Summary

### Original Task Breakdown (from agent-2-tasks.md)

- **Agent A:** Tasks 2.1.1-2.1.6 (6 sub-tasks) - Content Processing API implementation ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Agent B:** Tasks 2.2.1-2.2.6 (6 sub-tasks) - Knowledge Graph API implementation ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Agent C:** Tasks 2.3.1-2.3.5 (5 sub-tasks) - Realtime Communication implementation ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Total:** 17 sub-tasks distributed across 3 agents ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**

## Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Execution

All agents can work simultaneously as each microservice is independent:
- No blocking dependencies between services
- Each service has its own database/storage
- APIs are already defined with clear contracts

### Shared Resources

- **AI Provider Clients:** Agent A will use existing AI integration from `src/core/ai/`
- **Database Patterns:** All agents follow repository pattern from main system
- **Error Handling:** Use established WorkflowError patterns
- **Testing Framework:** Share testing utilities and patterns

## Agent-Specific Implementation Details

### Agent A - Content Processing Service

**Focus:** Replace hardcoded responses with real content analysis
- Implement document parsing for multiple formats
- Add AI-powered analysis using existing provider clients
- Create quality scoring algorithms
- Build metadata extraction pipelines

**Key Technologies:**
- Existing AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock)
- Document parsing libraries
- Text analysis algorithms
- PostgreSQL with SQLx

### Agent B - Knowledge Graph Service  

**Focus:** Replace placeholder responses with real graph operations
- Establish Dgraph connection and query execution
- Implement graph algorithms (traversal, pathfinding)
- Build relationship discovery mechanisms
- Create node/edge CRUD operations

**Key Technologies:**
- Dgraph GraphQL client
- Graph algorithms from `src/algorithms/`
- Connection pooling patterns
- Redis for query caching

### Agent C - Realtime Communication Service

**Focus:** Implement actor-based message routing
- Build WebSocket session management with actors
- Implement message persistence to PostgreSQL
- Create presence tracking system
- Add notification delivery mechanisms

**Key Technologies:**
- Actix actors for message handling
- WebSocket with actix-web-actors
- Redis for session state
- PostgreSQL for message history

## Testing Requirements

Each agent must:
1. Write unit tests for all business logic
2. Create integration tests with external dependencies
3. Ensure existing tests continue to pass
4. Add performance benchmarks where applicable

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Completeness:** All hardcoded responses replaced
2. **Test Coverage:** >80% coverage for new code
3. **Integration Success:** Services work with main workflow system
4. **Performance:** Meet latency requirements (<100ms for most operations)
5. **Error Handling:** Graceful failures with proper error messages

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Updates
- Each agent updates their task file with [x] markers
- Report any blockers or dependencies discovered
- Document any API changes or new requirements

### Completion Criteria
- All sub-tasks marked complete
- Tests passing (unit and integration)
- Code reviewed and follows conventions
- Documentation updated for new functionality

## Timeline

### Day 1: Core Implementation
- Replace stubbed endpoints with basic functionality
- Establish database connections
- Implement primary business logic

### Day 2: Advanced Features and Testing
- Complete remaining features
- Write comprehensive tests
- Performance optimization
- Integration testing

## Notes

- Use existing patterns from the main system
- Leverage shared utilities and error types
- Follow Rust idioms and project conventions
- Document any deviations or new patterns introduced
