This PRD represents the improvement iteration of the AI Workflow Engine, focusing on preparing the project for open source publication and release as a Rust crate on crates.io.

### Changes from Previous Version
- Generated from: tasks/project-prd.md
- Analysis report: tasks/iteration-analysis-20241218_120000.md
- Mode: improve
- Focus: Open source readiness and crate publication requirements

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Workflow Engine is a production-ready orchestration platform for building AI-powered applications with external service integrations. Built in Rust with Python MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, it provides a type-safe, scalable foundation for complex AI workflows.

### Key Differentiators
- **Type-safe workflow construction** with compile-time validation
- **Multi-transport MCP support** (HTTP, WebSocket, stdio)
- **Production-ready features** including monitoring, error handling, and distributed execution
- **Microservice architecture** for scalability and isolation
- **Comprehensive testing** including chaos and load testing

## Goals

1. Create a robust, production-ready AI workflow orchestration system
2. Provide seamless integration with external services via MCP
3. Enable both developers and non-technical users to create and manage AI workflows
4. Ensure scalability, reliability, and observability for enterprise use
5. Build a strong foundation for community-driven development

### Improvement Goals for This Iteration

6. **Prepare for open source publication** with proper licensing and community infrastructure
7. **Make the project crate.io ready** with appropriate metadata and structure
8. **Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms** across all components
9. **Improve API ergonomics** for better developer experience
10. **Strengthen type safety** throughout the public API

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to define complex AI workflows programmatically with type-safe APIs, so I can catch errors at compile time.

2. **As a system administrator**, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities, so I can ensure system reliability.

3. **As a data scientist**, I want to integrate various AI models and services easily, so I can focus on solving business problems.

4. **As a team lead**, I want clear documentation and examples, so my team can quickly adopt the platform.

5. **As an operations engineer**, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, so the system can handle failures gracefully.

6. **As an open source contributor**, I want clear contribution guidelines and a welcoming community, so I can help improve the project.

7. **As a Rust developer**, I want to use this as a crate dependency with minimal overhead, so I can integrate workflow capabilities into my applications.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Building a visual workflow designer (separate project)
2. Implementing AI models directly (use external services)
3. Creating a managed cloud service
4. Supporting non-Rust language bindings (initially)
5. Implementing a custom message queue system

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Principles
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between core engine, MCP protocol, and nodes
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time guarantees
- **Async-First**: Built on Tokio for efficient concurrent execution
- **Zero-Copy**: Minimize data copying for performance
- **Error Resilience**: Every failure point must have a recovery strategy

### API Design Guidelines
- **Intuitive Defaults**: Common use cases should be simple
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features available but not required
- **Type-Safe**: Prefer compile-time errors over runtime failures
- **Composable**: Small, focused APIs that work well together
- **Testable**: All public APIs must be easily testable

## Technical Considerations

1. **Rust Version**: Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) 1.70
2. **Async Runtime**: Tokio as the primary async runtime
3. **Serialization**: Serde for data interchange
4. **HTTP Framework**: Actix-web for REST APIs
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Diesel ORM (optional feature)
6. **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry-compatible instrumentation

### Additional Technical Considerations

7. **Crate Organization**: Workspace with separate crates for core, MCP, API, and nodes
8. **Feature Flags**: Optional dependencies for database, monitoring, and specific node types
9. **Platform Support**: Tier 1 support for Linux, macOS, Windows
10. **Documentation Build**: Must build cleanly on docs.rs
11. **Binary Size**: Core crate should be lightweight with minimal dependencies

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 1000+ downloads within 6 months of release
2. **Community**: 50+ GitHub stars and 10+ contributors
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in production deployments
4. **Performance**: <100ms overhead for workflow orchestration
5. **Developer Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating on crates.io

### Improvement Metrics

6. **Code Quality**: 0 unwrap/expect in production code paths
7. **Error Handling**: 100% of errors provide actionable context
8. **Test Coverage**: 80%+ line coverage across all crates
9. **Documentation**: 100% of public APIs have rustdoc comments
10. **Build Time**: <5 minutes for full CI pipeline

## Open Questions

1. Should we provide a synchronous API alongside the async API?
2. What should be the default feature set when adding as a dependency?
3. Should we support stable Rust or require nightly features?
4. How do we handle breaking changes in the MCP protocol?
5. Should examples be in a separate repository to reduce crate size?
