2. **Eliminate Security Vulnerabilities** to meet open source security standards  
3. **Complete Missing Implementations** to provide functional public APIs
4. **Establish Professional Error Handling** with proper error chaining and context
5. **Implement Rust API Guidelines** for naming, design patterns, and documentation
6. **Enable Staged Crates.io Publication** with proper dependency management
7. **Provide Comprehensive Documentation** with practical examples and usage patterns

### Open Source Readiness Goals

8. **Meet Rust Community Standards** for code quality, testing, and documentation
9. **Establish Professional Project Governance** with community files and contribution guidelines
10. **Create Developer-Friendly APIs** that are intuitive, type-safe, and well-documented
11. **Ensure Long-term Maintainability** through clean architecture and comprehensive testing

## User Stories

### Primary Users (Open Source Developers)

1. **As a Rust developer**, I want to easily install the workflow engine from crates.io, so that I can quickly start building AI workflows without complex setup.

2. **As an AI application developer**, I want type-safe workflow APIs with clear error messages, so that I can build reliable applications with confidence.

3. **As a contributor**, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can understand how to extend and improve the workflow engine.

4. **As a library user**, I want stable, well-tested APIs that follow Rust conventions, so that my applications remain maintainable as the library evolves.

4. **Advanced Integrations**: Defer complex external service integrations
5. **Enterprise Features**: Keep scope focused on core open source functionality
6. **Backward Compatibility**: No legacy API support during initial publication

## Design Considerations

### 1. **API Stability**

- Mock external dependencies for reliable testing
- Include property-based testing for complex algorithms
- Automate testing across multiple Rust versions and platforms

### 4. **Documentation Philosophy**
- Write documentation for users, not developers of the library
- Include practical examples that solve real problems
- Provide learning paths from beginner to advanced usage
- Maintain documentation in sync with code through automation

## Technical Considerations

### 1. **Rust Version Compatibility**
- Support Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of 1.75.0
- Test across stable, beta, and nightly Rust channels
- Use only stable Rust features in public APIs
- Document any nightly-only features clearly

### 2. **Dependency Management**
- Minimize required dependencies for core functionality

- Test on both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
- Document any platform-specific limitations
- Provide platform-specific installation instructions

### 4. **Performance Characteristics**
- Maintain sub-millisecond node processing targets
- Support high-throughput scenarios (15,000+ requests/second)
- Efficient memory usage for large workflows
- Comprehensive benchmarking and performance regression detection

### 5. **Security Considerations**

## Open Questions

1. **API Breaking Changes**: Should we fix API inconsistencies even if they require breaking changes?
2. **Feature Scope**: Which incomplete features should be disabled vs completed for initial release?
3. **Community Engagement**: How should we handle the initial community onboarding and feedback?
4. **Release Strategy**: Should we do a beta release first or go directly to 1.0?
5. **Long-term Maintenance**: What's the long-term governance and maintenance plan for the open source project?
