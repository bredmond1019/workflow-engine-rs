# AI Workflow Orchestration System - Stabilization & Completion PRD

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: December 6, 2024  
**Based on**: VALIDATION_REPORT.md findings  
**Target Audience**: Development team (junior to senior developers)  

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The AI Workflow Orchestration System currently suffers from critical gaps between its documentation claims and actual implementation. The validation report identified that while the system has an excellent architectural foundation (especially in monitoring and MCP integration), many core features are stubbed with `todo!()` macros, documentation examples don't compile, and the development environment has blocking setup issues.

**Problem Statement**: The system is presented as "production-ready" but lacks functional core features, has broken development setup, and misleading documentation that prevents adoption and contribution.

**Goal**: Transform the AI Workflow Orchestration System into a truly production-ready platform with working examples, complete core functionality, and a smooth developer experience.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Eliminate Critical Blockers**: Fix all database setup issues, failing tests, and development environment blockers so new developers can contribute immediately
2. **Complete Core Functionality**: Replace all stubbed functions with working implementations, particularly AI agent processing and workflow execution
3. **Align Documentation with Reality**: Ensure all README examples compile and work, and documentation accurately reflects implemented features
4. **Achieve Production Readiness**: Implement missing event sourcing, improve test coverage, and add performance benchmarks
5. **Establish Sustainable Development**: Create CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and contribution guidelines to prevent regression
