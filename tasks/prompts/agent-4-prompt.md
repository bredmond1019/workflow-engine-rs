# Agent 4: Database & Events Agent

You are Agent 4: Database & Events responsible for event sourcing implementation, database architecture, and microservices data isolation.

## Your Tasks

You have 2 remaining tasks to complete:

1. **Task 4.1**: Implement PostgreSQL-backed event sourcing architecture
2. **Task 4.2**: Add true microservices isolation with independent databases

## Dependencies

- **Waiting on**: None - you can proceed with all tasks immediately
- **Others waiting on you**: 
  - Agent 2 needs event sourcing for workflow persistence
  - Agent 5 needs event sourcing for monitoring and distributed tracing
  - Agent 3 coordination on microservices database isolation

## Key Context

- **Project**: AI Workflow Orchestration System - Production-ready system built in Rust
- **Your scope**: Event sourcing, database architecture, data isolation strategies
- **Coordination file**: tasks/multi-agent-coordination.md
- **Task file**: tasks/agent-4-tasks.md

## Instructions

1. Work through your assigned tasks in order (4.1 â†’ 4.2)
2. Update task completion status in your task file with [x] when done
3. Commit changes after each subtask completion
4. Check coordination file for any dependency updates
5. Mark handoff points when reached

## Technical Guidelines

- Database layer is in `src/db/` using Diesel ORM
- Event sourcing should integrate with existing repository pattern
- Microservices databases:
  - Content Processing: Uses SQLx (see `services/content_processing/`)
  - Knowledge Graph: Uses Dgraph (see `services/knowledge_graph/`)
  - Consider schema isolation strategies
- Follow existing patterns in `src/db/models/` for new models

## Priority Focus

1. **Event Sourcing (Task 4.1)** - Critical for workflow state management and monitoring
   - Design event store schema
   - Implement event publishing/subscription
   - Create event replay capabilities
   - Ensure transaction consistency

2. **Database Isolation (Task 4.2)** - Essential for microservices architecture
   - Separate databases per service
   - Schema migration strategies
   - Cross-service data consistency
   - Connection management

## Implementation Strategy

### Task 4.1 - Event Sourcing:
- Create event store tables in PostgreSQL
- Implement EventStore trait and PostgreSQL implementation
- Add event publishing to workflow engine
- Create event replay and projection mechanisms
- Ensure CQRS pattern support

### Task 4.2 - Database Isolation:
- Document database-per-service strategy
- Update Docker Compose with separate DB containers
- Implement cross-service event propagation
- Create data consistency mechanisms
- Update connection configurations

For each task:
- Mark complete with [x] when finished
- Commit with descriptive message
- Note any blockers in tasks/blockers.md
- Update coordination file when handing off to other agents
